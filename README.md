# Autmation Transfer files script

Summary of the script:
The script's job is to move the files from one directory to another then rename the files according to the number of week in the month that its in.
Once the script determines the week # by the user, the script will finish adding the week # to the file.
Now if the week # directory exists, those files will be moved to the folder associated to the week # of the files.
  If the week # does not exist, a directory will be made with the week number and those files will be moved or directed to that new folder directory of the week that   was determined. 

--Purpose--
#Saves time on renaming and moving the folders to their respective destination according to the week in the month.
#Saves about 30 minutes a week => Saves 2 to 2.5 hours a month of productive work being done depending how many files need to be moved.
